This is a fictional use case for a simple few lines of code, a microcontroller and a stepper motor.

## You'll need:
- Raspberry Pi Pico
- Stepper Motor and Driver Board (we use the 28BYJ-48)
- 6 wires, ideally with female dupont connectors at one end
- An application that requires turning a thing at roughly predefined intervals
